**1. Topic:** <br>
I would like to investigate the language use of the characters of the American series *Modern Family* (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1442437/). I intend to focus on the factors of age and gender impacting language use.

**2. Context:** <br>
Linguistic variation has been observed across age and gender, among other features (Ehrlich et al. 2017, Eckert 2017). For example, younger speakers tend to use more slang words than older speakers (Barbieri 2008) or that women tend to use more emotive words than men.

**3. Research questions:** <br>
Main question: <br>
Are there any differences in the word-choice of the characters along the lines of age and gender in the series *Modern Family*? What are these differences?

Subquestions: <br>
What words are used most frequently by male and by female characters? <br>
What words are used most frequently by younger and older characters? <br>
How are slang words used? By which characters? How old are they?

**4. How to explore the topic and address the research question:** <br>
The American series *Modern Family* features multiple characters, male and female, of different ages. The series has 11 seasons which allows us to look at the characters’ language use over time (in different seasons) as well, which may provide valuable insights, especially in the case of the development of the younger characters. The lines and the word-usage of different characters could  be examined. The most-frequently occurring words could be collected and compared and contrasted according to variables, such as character, age and gender. <br>
When drawing conclusions we need to be careful and consider the limitations of the research, such as the nature of the language of the series. First, the data consists of scripted and not naturally-occurring conversations, hence, we cannot make generalizations easily. Second, the genre of the series, i. e. sitcom, impacts and restricts language use as well (e.g. low number of swearwords).

**5. Data:** <br>
I would need the transcripts of the episodes in a way that it is possible to identify which lines belong to which characters. (I do not know if this is available and accessible.) The subtitles might not provide information about which lines belong to which characters.

**6. Tools and methods:** <br>
A program that is able to count word-frequency and create concordances could be used to carry out this research. The use of nltk may be useful.
